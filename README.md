CrocsSwimLog is an app made for swimmers of all skill levels, from those who swim to stay in shape to those who aim to be the best of the best. It serves as a tool to log your workouts 
and find new drills through the Drill Of The Day. It's a simple, clean, and helpful app, designed for ease of use and understanding.

HOW TO USE - 
To further help our users, and help any coders understand what's going on under the hood, below is a simple guide on what each page consists of and how to use them.

HOME PAGE - 
Upon loading into the app, you'll land on the Home Page. This screen simply consists of our logo, an inspiring quote, and a small dashboard. This dashboard shows the averages of all the workouts currently logged in the app. It will start at 0, but then as more entries get added, the stats will update. 

NAV BAR - 
Looking at the bottom, you'll see the navigation bar, which has 4 seperate pages. The first button is the Home Page. The second button is the Swim Log. The third button is for adding entries for the swim log. Finally, the 4th button will take you to the Drill Of The Day Page. This navbar is consistent amongst all the pages on the site for ease of use.

SWIM LOG SCREEN - 
The Swim Log screen shows any entries added to the swim log, with the latest entry being on top. With no entries in the log, it will simply be an empty square. If you click on an entry, it'll be deleted from the log, which will actively update the screen and the averages on the Home Page.

NEW ENTRY SCREEN - 
The New Entry Screen is a form consisting of 4 text input boxes and a button to take a photo. Below those are a submit button to send in your entry, which upon click puts your inputs into the database, and a cancel button, both of which redirect to the Home Page after clicking on them. In order, you input the date of the workout, the time duration of the workout (in minutes), the main stroke swam, and the total yardage. Upon clicking the add/take photo button, you'll be redirected to a new screen to open the camera. Upon clicking that button, the camera will be opened, allowing a photo to be taken. Once a photo is taken, you're redirected back to the New Entry Screen, where right below the button, the text, "photo attatched" will now appear right under, as long as a valid photo was taken.

DRILL OF THE DAY SCREEN - 
This screen is straight and to the point. Upon loading onto the screen, a random drill is chosen out of 20 potential options. Once chosen, this drill is displayed with all the detail that goes with it, including its name, a photo of the stroke in question, the drills description, and the reccommended yardage for getting the most out of the drill. At the bottom, a "Generate New Drill" button sits, and upon click, picks a new random drill and updates the information on the screen accordingly.

Crocs Swim Log was made with passion for the craft of both UX/UI Design, App Creation, and Swimming, and came out as a product honed and finely tuned to help any potential user. As you explore and use the app, I hope that you feel the same energy we did when creating it.
