CrocsSwimLog is an app made for swimmers of all skill levels, from those who swim to stay in shape to those who aim to be the best of the best. It serves as a tool to log your workouts and 
and find new drills through the Drill Of The Day. It's a simple, clean, and helpful app, and the finished product will be glorious.


This is a semester project that is still a work in progress. The features that still need to be added are:
  Database Functionality (Submitting workout entries and having them be properly stored then displayed, along with the analytics on the Home Page)
  Camera Functionality (With every entry to the swim log, you will also have the option to take a photo/video or pick a preexisting photo/video to upload along with the workout entry)
